This is our proposal for Google's Season of Docs 2021.

Technical writers: please contact us if you are interested in
helping improve RNP documentation!

This is the proposal for Google's Season of Docs 2021.

== About RNP

RNP (https://www.rnpgp.org) is an open-source, openly-licensed RNP
cryptography suite, which aims to facilitate usable end-to-end
encryption based on zero-trust. Its high-performance C++ library
provides a set of cryptographic primitives compliant with the
OpenPGP (RFC 4880) standard.

RNP is used by Mozilla’s Thunderbird to enable end-to-end encryption across
its 35+ million users, enabling Thunderbird to be the world’s most
popular mail client that supports end-to-end encryption. RNP has
undergone heavy security testing by Mozilla and Cure53, with public
security reports provided on the Internet.

The RNP suite is officially supported and funded by the
Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS)
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/foundational-technology/[Foundational Technology] and
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/secure-open-source/[Secure Open Source] funds,
and the https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/[EU Horizons 2020] program
through NLNet's NGI Privacy Enhancing Technology Fund.


== Volunteer Mentors

The following individuals of the project community have offered to act as volunteer mentors for this project:

* Daniel Wyatt, Lead Developer of the RNP OpenPGP library. IETF standards participant, previously at FEMA. Contributor to multiple cryptographic tools including OpenSSL, LibreSSL, Botan. 3 times Google Summer of Code participant.

* Dr. Wai Kit Wong, Head of Research at Ribose. Published heavily in cryptographic cloud systems. Former Associate Professor in Computer Science and Head of the Department of Computing at Hang Seng University of Hong Kong.


== Project description

=== Current status

RNP currently provides minimal API documentation as an integrated
library, which is insufficient for most developers who need to
perform native integration, and inadequate for those who utilize RNP
from the command line. Better documentation will aid more pairs of
eyes to review and improve adoption of the RNP library, which will
help expose problems not yet discovered in RNP. This category of
work aims to provide a reference guide for both the library and CLI,
and provide a set of guides for easier adoption of the RNP
components.

Documentation of code with on-going development is a headache for
development teams.

It is very often that existing documentation is outdated and thus not helpful.

The development team needs to spare additional efforts to develop documentation for Doxygen is a more
scalable way to update the documentation.

It parses the sources and
generates the documentation automatically.

Documentation can be made
up-to-date easily and reduces efforts from the development team.
This project shall use Doxygen for developing the documentation to
achieve a more efficient documentation routine in the long run.

=== Project scope

This project aims to achieve the two following goals:

. Develop up-to-date and more detailed documentation of the project, and
. use an automated code documentation tool like Doxygen.

Specifically, the tasks of the technical writer in this project
would include the following:

* Audit the existing documentation and codes to identify gaps between them
* Work with the project team to develop missing documentation
* Develop/Update the documentation to use Doxygen
* Perform a usability test on the documentation and identify parts that are the most difficult to follow
* Use the result from the usability test to develop more comprehensive documentation for the top prioritized use cases


== Potential impacts of the project

Two objectives are sought of the project:

. provide detailed and updated documentation to aid more users to join the project community; and
. adopt Doxygen to keep the documentation up-to-date.

* The first objective can be reflected by the number of (new) users of project documentation.
* The second objective is straight-forward to realize.

The project would be considered successful if, after the project:

* Unique traffic to project documentation increases by 10%; and
* Documentation can be generated automatically from annotated code.
